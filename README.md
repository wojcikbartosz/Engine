# Engine
This project is a part of process of building a simple prototype of hydrogen engine.
The goal of this project is to recive data from STM32 microcontroller via UART port, save them to a history file and draw some charts by GNUplot.
This code is capable of doing that right now, and this is all i need in this phase of my building procces. In future i am goin to make it pretty and expand
its functionality.
